# Snake-Game-using-cpp
This is a snake game using c++. This is a very simple program. I implement this in a very simple way. The code is easy to understand and anyone can learn from it and make a program by your own.
Snake Game
This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic Snake game using C++. The game uses the Windows console for input and output, and it includes features such as changing the snake's direction, growing the snake when it eats food, and detecting collisions.

Game Rules
The snake starts at a fixed position and moves in the direction specified by the user.
The snake grows in length each time it eats food.
The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the console window.
The score increases with each piece of food eaten.


Code Structure
Constants: The directions and maximum length of the snake are defined as constants.
Functions:
initScreen(): Initializes the screen dimensions.
gotoxy(int x, int y): Moves the cursor to the specified coordinates on the console.


Classes:
Point: Represents a coordinate on the console.
Snake: Manages the snake's properties and behaviors, including movement, direction changes, and growth.
Board: Manages the game board, including drawing the snake and food, updating the game state, handling user input, and spawning food.


Future Improvements
Implementing levels with increasing difficulty.
Adding obstacles on the board.
Allowing the game to be played in different modes (e.g., endless mode, time trial).
Adding sound effects.
Enhancing the graphics using a better library or framework.
